Test app RequireJS
==================

- Current app is a simple test to do some sketchs using requirejs and jasmine.
- The idea behind this is to be able to apply this to my professional development.
- There's no other objectives behind this project but to do some tests

- SpecRunner doesn't pass the etst. Seems there's a misconfiguration on jasmine standalone.
