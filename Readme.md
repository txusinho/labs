Txus' lab
=========

- The following project is just a placeholder for the different tests I at home
- There's no other purpose but to have a backup of my code, my precioussss code, Gollum, Gollum!

Current projects
================
- ES6 -> some minor tests using the traceur compiler for ES6. Future is here, dudes!
- requireJS -> requireJS + angular are good friends, or not?
- ff92 -> One of my first projects. Originally programmed in C and compiled with DJGPP and allegro. For windows. Needs a huge rewrite.
